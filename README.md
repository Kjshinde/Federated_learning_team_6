# Tools and libraries

- [Flower](https://flower.ai/)	- Easy-to-use Python library for federated learning. Lets you simulate multiple clients on your own machine. Highly recommended for class projects.
- [TensorFlow Federated (TFF)](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated) - 	Great if you're comfortable with TensorFlow. Provides structured APIs for federated training.
- [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)	Focused on federated learning + privacy techniques, but can be tricky for beginners.
